This is a file          to              test              a bunch of potential edge cases, e.g. potential bugs!

The natural language tokenizer library tripped up on   most
edge cases, and caused a lot of issues. Spacy seems
to be the
way                     to go.

It did not behave right with stuf like u.s.a, e.g. and some very basic cases
.
